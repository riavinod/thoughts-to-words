Thoughts 2 Words

Train a neural net to convert text into my handwriting? or vice versa? more to come. I like my handwriting, and I would take more notes if typing weren't faster. I'm going to try and train [SOMETHING] that will input text and output maybe images? of the same text in my handwriting. Good thing I have thousands of training documents lol. Thanks to high school English exams. :)


- imaging
- look at the paper for more ideas
- which type of network??
- layers and features
